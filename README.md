# Build a Drum Machine

## Challenge

[View the challenge on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine)

### Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: [https://drum-machine.freecodecamp.rocks/](https://drum-machine.freecodecamp.rocks/).

## Features

- Interactive drum pads that produce different sounds when clicked or pressed
- Volume control for adjusting the sound level
- Display of the current sound being played
- Keyboard support for playing sounds

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- HTML: Markup language for structuring the web page
- CSS: Styling language for designing the user interface

## Getting Started

To run the drum machine locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/milliorn/drum-machine.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd drum-machine`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the drum machine.

## Source

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Learn more about Create React App in the [official documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
